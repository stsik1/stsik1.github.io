Hello! My name is Sean Tsikteris, and I am a PhD student in Computer Engineering attending Arizona State University.

I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant inside of the Performance and Resource OpTimizatiOn in Networks Lab (PROTON) Lab at Arizona State University. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of New Mexico in December, 2023, and received my master's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of New Mexico in December, 2024. Currently, I'm working towards my Ph.D in Computer Engineering under Dr. Eirini Eleni Tsiropoulou with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering at Arizona State University. Inside of the PROTON Lab, I work alongside Prof. Tsiropoulou and fellow research assistants on a variety of projects, with my main interests being in optimization, autonomous systems, reinforcement learning, game theory, distributed decision-making, multi-robot Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and GPS denial navigation.
